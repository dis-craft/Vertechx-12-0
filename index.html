            <h2>Earthquake Alerts</h2>
            <div id="earthquakeInfo">
                <p>Cause: Sudden release of energy from the Earth’s crust, typically due to tectonic plate movements.
                    Alert Time: Seconds to a few minutes
                    Earthquakes typically provide little to no warning. However, modern earthquake early warning systems can offer alerts seconds to a minute before the shaking reaches a specific area.
                    Immediate Actions:
                    Drop, Cover, and Hold On.
                    Take cover under sturdy furniture or against an interior wall away from windows.
                    Avoid using elevators.
                    Precautions During Alert:
                    Stay indoors, away from glass and exterior walls.
                    If outdoors, move to an open space, away from buildings and power lines.
                    Prepare for aftershocks.</p>

            <h2>Landslides and Avalanches</h2>
            <div id="earthquakeInfo">
                <p>Cause: Landslides are caused by rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, or human activity that destabilizes slopes. Avalanches are triggered by heavy snowfall or rapid temperature changes.
                    Alert Time: Minutes to hours
                    Landslides may occur suddenly but can sometimes be anticipated based on weather patterns, while avalanches may be forecasted when snow conditions are closely monitored.
                    Immediate Actions:
                    Seek higher ground or move to an area less prone to slides.
                    Avoid rivers or valleys at the base of hills during heavy rain.
                    For avalanches, drop to the ground and try to create space for breathing if caught.
                    Precautions During Alert:
                    Avoid steep, unstable slopes.
                    Stay informed about weather conditions in avalanche-prone areas.
                    Follow evacuation orders and avoid mountainous areas during heavy snowfall or rainfall.</p>

            <h2>Tsunamis</h2>
            <div id="earthquakeInfo">
                <p>Cause: Underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides displacing large amounts of water.
                    Alert Time: Minutes to hours (depending on proximity to the epicenter)
                    Tsunamis triggered by underwater earthquakes may provide some warning if detected quickly. Coastal areas closer to the epicenter may only have minutes to evacuate, while those farther away might have hours.
                    Immediate Actions:
                    Head to higher ground immediately if you feel the earthquake or see a rapid water retreat.
                    Evacuate coastal areas if warned.
                    Precautions During Alert:
                    Move to at least 100 feet above sea level or 1 mile inland.
                    Follow evacuation routes and do not return to coastal areas until authorities declare it safe.</p>

            <h2>Hurricanes, Cyclones, and Typhoons</h2>
            <div id="earthquakeInfo">
                <p>Cause: Low-pressure systems over warm ocean waters, causing high winds, rain, and storm surges.
                    Alert Time: Hours to days
                    These storms are tracked well in advance, and meteorological agencies can predict their path and intensity days before landfall. Alerts typically come 24–72 hours in advance of expected landfall.
                    Immediate Actions:
                    Evacuate to a shelter if instructed, or move to an interior room with no windows.
                    Stock up on water, food, and medical supplies.
                    Protect windows and doors with shutters or plywood.
                    Precautions During Alert:
                    Have an emergency kit with essentials (water, food, medications).
                    Secure outdoor objects and furniture to prevent damage from winds.
                    Stay indoors during the storm and avoid using the phone.</p>

            <h2>Tornadoes</h2>
            <div id="earthquakeInfo">
                <p>Cause: Severe thunderstorms, particularly supercells, generate rotating columns of air that can develop into tornadoes.
                    Alert Time: Minutes to an hour
                    Tornado warnings typically come 10–30 minutes before the tornado touches down. Weather conditions conducive to tornado formation can be monitored, leading to tornado watches issued in advance.
                    Immediate Actions:
                    Take shelter in a basement or a small, windowless interior room.
                    Avoid mobile homes and vehicles.
                    If outdoors, lie flat in a ditch or depression.
                    Precautions During Alert:
                    Secure your home by reinforcing doors and windows.
                    Stay updated with weather warnings.
                    Have a disaster kit with essentials ready.</p>

            <h2>Wildfires</h2>
            <div id="earthquakeInfo">
                <p>Cause: Human activity, lightning, or extreme heat can spark fires in dry vegetation.
                    Alert Time: Minutes to hours
                    Wildfires can spread rapidly, particularly in dry and windy conditions, and may give hours of notice. However, evacuation may be urgent as the fire grows rapidly.
                    Immediate Actions:
                    Evacuate immediately if in the fire’s path.
                    Close windows and doors to prevent smoke inhalation.
                    If trapped, try to find a body of water to protect yourself.
                    Precautions During Alert:
                    Clear dry vegetation and flammable materials from around your home.
                    Create defensible space (e.g., trimmed trees) around buildings.
                    Ensure fire extinguishers are accessible and in good condition.</p>
